# Webfishing Automasher
an automasher mod for webfishing for people with hand issues

## How to install
1. Download the latest release of DeltaPatcher (https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/latest)
2. Download the .xdelta file off of this repository for the version of the game you are playing on
3. Open DeltaPatcher and patch the webfishing.pck file inside of your WEBFISHING steam install using the .xdelta file

## Why closed source? 
Right now there is no easy way to make a Webfishing mod open source while also being easy to install, there currently is a Webfishing mod loader in the works but it requires you to manually decompile the entire game and for the average person that is easier said than done.<br>
If the mod loader ever gets more feature complete and easier to install i will absolutely port this mod over to it! But right now it will stay as just a DeltaPatcher mod.

## Big thanks to my ko-fi supporters!
